## Hi Dr. Read,

I hope you're doing well. This is my website, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

## üìê Website Design Inspiration

The design of this website was inspired by:

1. Elements from YouTube
2. A student‚Äôs project published about a year ago
3. Support from ChatGPT
4. Focus on mobile compatibility

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `images/` ‚Äî Contains all necessary images and PDF files
- `index.html` ‚Äî Contains about 90% of the main website components
- `skills.html` ‚Äî Additional skills that didn‚Äôt fit into the main website
- `style.css` ‚Äî Contains all the required styling
- `submissions.csv` ‚Äî Stores all logged email messages
- `email.js` ‚Äî Sends form data using JavaScript and a free SMTP service (up to 200 emails/day)
- `save.php` ‚Äî A PHP script that logs form data to a .csv file (added later for bonus marks)

---

## ‚ùì Why Use JavaScript for Form Submission Instead of PHP?

### Benefits of the JavaScript Method:
- Free hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages)
- Easier to implement
- No need for a paid server

To use PHP with email SMTP, I would need a hosting plan with an Apache + PHP environment, which can cost 266 SAR/year.

With JavaScript:
- You can host the site on GitHub
- Sync it with your local files
- Buy a custom domain (30‚Äì80 SAR max)

## üôè Final Note

Thank you for the great finale.  
I always had a wish to take another course with you before graduating ‚Äî and that wish finally came true this last semester.

I need one small favor:  
Inside the `images/` folder, you'll find two versions of my CV: `verA` and `verB`.  
I‚Äôm currently using `verB` on the website.

As an HR supervisor, could you kindly check:

- Which version is more likely to pass ATS (Applicant Tracking System) filters?
- Which one makes a better first impression to a recruiter?

I‚Äôm also currently studying two professional certificates, and any feedback or suggestions for improvement would mean a lot.

Thank you again!

‚Äî Hatem
